An Ethereum Browser


Still under development. Binaries for the various platforms (when appropriate) will be available at: [https://github.com/projectdnet/ethos/releases](https://github.com/projectdnet/ethos/releases).

##Development Build

This application is essentially a node-webkit wrapper around other [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) projects and [IPFS](http://ipfs.io) which when used together make for a better DApp user experience.

## Getting started

Ethos aims to be the easiest way to use Ethereum for non technical users. Once installed and run for the first time, the user should be prompted whether they what it to launch at startup. This then handles running both Ethereum and IPFS nodes under the hood. Allowing the end user to use their browser of choice to interact with the network.
